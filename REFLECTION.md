## Describe the functionality of your code and its components. How do your code segments work together to meet the project's objectives?
- The <!DOCTYPE html> tag declares the document type and version of HTML being used
- Divide the content into several section and use head, and body part to make it more clear and readable.
- Creat spaced-text and bold-text to ensure that the class names are consistent and self-explanatory. If other elements also need similar spacing or boldness, I can combine these styles where applicable.
- The whole Content is organized into sections with headings, text, and images and SVGs are used inline to add visual icons.
## Reflect on your approach from planning to execution. How did you organize your work, and what strategies did you employ?
- AT first,I followed the instruction of the assignment and combine with my resume I made before to creat a clear structure.
- Then I followed the steps of the assignment to add more information and adjust the stucture as well.
- I used descriptive class names (.spaced-text, .bold-text) to keep the code organized and make it easy to apply consistent styles across different elements.
- I carefully selected SVG icons on google to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage.
- I continuously checked by using Html Checker to ensure there is no error and warning.
## Identify and describe any obstacles you encountered while working on this project. How did you address or overcome these challenges?
- At first, I didn't know how to set the spacing, but after researching online, I learned how to set style and class. This step played a significant role in the overall setup of my resume.
- When it came time to add SVGs, I didn't know how to set them up either. However, I remembered that my instructor mentioned I could Google for help. So, I Googled some SVG icons and incorporated them into my resume. This was the first time I successfully used SVGs.
## Given what you have learned through this project, what changes would you make to your approach or your code if you were to start over?
- Throughout the process, I learned how to set up bold-text and spaced-text, and I also learned how to use SVGs from the web. Additionally, I became more proficient in using <span> and <br>.
- As a result, creating the resume was relatively straightforward. If I were to start again, I would still begin by organizing the structure of my resume and then refining it accordingly. However, I would like to learn more CSS to enhance the readability of the resume.
